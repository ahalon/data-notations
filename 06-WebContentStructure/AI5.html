    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</a></h1>

    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> refers to the development
    of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
    requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
    problem-solving, understanding natural language,
    recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>

    <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
    and techniques, such as machine learning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural
    language processing</a>, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
    <p>The main ideas in artificial intelligence are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Systems learn from data
            without being directly programmed. (e.g., recommendation systems).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Machines understand
            and generate human language. (e.g., voice assistants).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Machines interpret visual data (images/videos).
            (e.g., facial recognition, self-driving cars).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Robotics:</strong> AI gives robots the ability to perform tasks
            on their own.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Expert Systems:</strong> AI mimics human knowledge
            in specific fields (e.g., medical help).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>AI is used as voice assistants. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a>, Google Assistant,
    and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
    commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
    recommend products or shows based on your previous
    interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
    roads and make driving decisions.</p>

    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as
    healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing.
    However, ethical considerations, such as job
    displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also
    key topics of discussion. The development of AI is
    likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily
    life in the years to come.</p>
