    <h1>Laptop</h1>

    <p>A <strong>laptop</strong>, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) that typically has a clamshell form factor, with a screen on the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and touchpad on the lower lid. The size and shape of modern laptops are constantly evolving, leading to new categories such as "ultrabooks" and "netbooks," although the fundamental design remains the same.</p>

    <p>Laptops are generally designed to have all the features of a desktop computer, including a display, keyboard, pointing device, processor, memory, and storage, integrated into one portable unit. They are powered by an internal rechargeable battery and an external AC adapter. You can find more details on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">Wikipedia - Laptop</a>.</p>

    <h2>Types of Laptops</h2>

    <p><strong>Notebooks and Ultraportables:</strong> Traditional notebooks and ultraportables are designed to balance performance and portability. Ultraportables are lighter and thinner than standard notebooks, often sacrificing some performance or port options for maximum mobility.</p>

    <p><strong>2-in-1 Laptops (Convertibles and Detachables):</strong> These are flexible devices that can function as both a laptop and a tablet. Convertibles have a screen that swivels or folds 360 degrees, while detachables allow the keyboard to be completely removed from the screen.</p>

    <p><strong>Gaming Laptops:</strong> These are high-performance laptops equipped with powerful processors (CPUs) and dedicated graphics cards (GPUs) to handle demanding video games. They tend to be bulkier and heavier due to the need for advanced cooling systems.</p>

    <h2>Laptop Hardware</h2>

    <p>The hardware of a laptop, like any personal computer, consists of electronic components that work together to run software. To maintain portability and a small form factor, these components are usually smaller and highly integrated compared to desktop counterparts. This integration is crucial for fitting powerful computing capabilities into a thin and light chassis.</p>

    <p>The entire system is connected through a motherboard, which houses or links all the core components. Efficient thermal management (cooling) is also a key hardware challenge in portable computers.</p>
